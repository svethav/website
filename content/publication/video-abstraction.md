abstract = "The work provided the field of multimedia with the earliest systematic review of video abstraction. It was pioneering in its manner of classifying available methods for video abstraction, a fundamental problem in video indexing and retrieval. This technology is core to many commonplace tasks such as video search in Google or Youtube. At that time, it was an emerging field, and many methods were developing quickly. It was difficult to know what should be the benchmark for new techniques. We solved this problem by proposing the first systematic framework and the most comprehensive review of the field. It focused strongly on identifying critical aspects of video abstraction, ranging from problem formulation to result evaluation, analyzing and classifying how these are addressed in various works."
