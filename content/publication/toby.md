abstract = "This work is the first of its kind and is still considered as ground-breaking and pioneering in early intervention in autism using technology. The work was published in SiGCHI, the top rated computer science conference on human computer interfaces with a h5 index of 84, and is testimony to its novel academic content. It was the first to formulate the computational problem of early intervention and then to translate it into rigorous algorithms and methods for delivering such programs to children as young as 2. The work encompassed all aspects of early teaching: a) a syllabus, ordered by complexity in 5 early skill development areas - visual/audio sensory matching, social skills, gross motor skills, expressive and receptive language; b) a library of reusable multimedia resources to provide content for this syllabus; and, c) solutions to adapt to each childâ€™s skills and to teach parents unfamiliar concepts core to behavioural therapy, such as prompting and fading."
